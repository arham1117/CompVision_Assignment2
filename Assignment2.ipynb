You don't need to understand all the details, but try to get an idea of how it works. ORB combines the FAST corner detector (covered in week 3) and the BRIEF descriptor.

[Detect features] Create opencv ORB feature extractor by `orb=cv2.ORB_create()`. Then you can detect keypoints by `kp = orb.detect(img,None)`, and compute descriptors by `kp, des = orb.compute(img, kp)`. You need to do this for each image, and then you can use `cv2.drawKeypoints()` for visualization.\n","\n","3. [Match features] As ORB is a binary feature, you need to use HAMMING distance for matching, e.g., `bf = cv2.BFMatcher(cv2.NORM_HAMMING)`. Then you are requried to do KNN matching (k=2) by using `bf.knnMatch()`. After that, you are required to use \"ratio_test\" to find good matches. By default, you can set `ratio=0.8`.\n","\n","4. [Plot and analyze] You need to visualize the matches by using the `cv2.drawMatches()` function. Also you can change the ratio values, parameters in `cv2.ORB_create()`, and distance functions in `cv2.BFMatcher()`.
